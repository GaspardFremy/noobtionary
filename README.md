# :blue_book: noobtionary

**Purpose**

It's a class project. We had to make a collaborative dictionary app (mobile frame in browser). Definitions needed to be validate by 3 users before go public.
For UX friendly purpose, Noobtionary is based on a ranking system. It's possible to find x time the same definition, nonetheless they will be sort by their rank when searching them. 



**How to launch it**

- Duplicate localy the db using the mysql>noobtionary.sql dump file
- if Windows user, edit dbConnect() function in model.php ('root' -> ''), same with controller>fetchData.php
- You have to be logged to try it. You can use this log -> email : 1, password : 1 (email are not secured yet)
